## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### List of favorite Apps and Features
-Pinterest
  Love love love the UI it's calming, the rounded, soft content bubbles.
  The ads are immersed in the content.
  
-Duolingo
  The learning sections/path, minimal words on the landing page
  Animations are cute.
  There is a notebook icon next to each section where you can review summaries of what you learned. Good for quick refreshers.
  
-TikTok
  The algorithm, it constantly brings you new content from people all over the world 
      not just the people who pay for ads.
  The location of the controls (like, follow, share) easy to reach.


### App Idea

-Duolingo but for Astrology 
  They have built apps that are set up similar to duolingo but they are for cooking finance and anger management. I want to create
  an app for astrology girlies. Where one can learn more about their houses and the history of astrology.
  The start of the program will ask for date of birth, time and name. There will be a separate section for viewing your own birth chart.
  There will be a feature to add friends/family/romantic partners. The main draw to my app would be the timely and specific 
  notifications of when their is a planet alignment that may effect the user. Include an manifesting section.
  

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while building the app were:
-I was unfamilar with Xcode and it is vastly different from my normal IDE VsCode.
Every step felt like I was making it more difficult than it needed to be. None of it was intuitive.
I would like to aspire to make my apps as inuitive as possible. 
      To work through this ---> I tried to watch a few youtube videos outside of the provided resources.

-Adding additional features took the longest. I thought of them immediately but implementing them was more effort than I originally thought.
This is my first time writing in Swift. I had to get a grasp of how the elements/files work together.
I couldn't open the editor for a minute. 

-Uploading to github
Again, I am very familar with vs code and the terminal. Had to watch another video on how to upload to github without a terminal.
I couldn't find that in Xcode.
